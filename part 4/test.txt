I have tested that the multi-channel chat system works by doing the following:

1. First, I opened a terminal window and entered the correct command to start the server:
python mc_server.py <ip> <post_port> <pub_port> --> python3 mc_server.py <ip> 7777 5505



2. Then I openend another two terminals to test communication in one channel:
python mc_client.py <ip> <post_port> <pub_port> <channel> <name>
The first user was python3 mc_client.py 127.0.0.1 7777 5505 books linn
The second user was python3 mc_client.py 127.0.0.1 7777 5505 books rheea
Everything worked:
Output in one of the two terminals:

Subscribed to channel 'books'

books rheea: Hello Linn! (10-25-2025 13:21:17)
Hello Rheea!!

books linn: Hello Rheea!! (10-25-2025 13:21:26)



3. Then I opened a fourth terminal to create another channel:
python mc_client.py <ip> <post_port> <pub_port> <channel> <name>
python3 mc_client.py <ip> 7777 5505 sports chad
Everything worked, messages only showed on that channel:

Subscribed to channel 'sports'
Yoooo Bros!

sports chad: Yoooo Bros! (10-25-2025 13:24:37)

4. Lastly, I created a new terminal to view incoming messages from all channels, as read-only
python mc_client.py <ip> <post_port> <pub_port> <channel> <name>
python3 mc_client.py <ip> 7777 5505 ALL viewer

Everything worked here as well! All messages from other channels showed up, while the viewer could not send any.
Output on the terminal:

Subscribed to all channels (read-only)
You cannot write into this channel (read-only)

books linn: wiwiwiwi (10-25-2025 13:27:27)

books rheea: lalalalala (10-25-2025 13:27:32)

books rheea: yippieee!!! (10-25-2025 13:27:37)

sports chad: Hey guys!  (10-25-2025 13:27:55)

sports chad: Losers! (10-25-2025 13:27:58)

books linn: YIPPIEEEE!!! (10-25-2025 13:28:11)

5. To exit, i typed in EXIT into one of the channels and it showed up only inside the channel, the ALL channel, and on the server.
Output:
sports chad: EXIT (10-25-2025 13:30:43)

sports chad has left the chat.
